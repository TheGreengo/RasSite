# RasSite
Just a simple webpage to run as a test on my raspberry pi. The goal is to serve a little checklist app (using flask) on my raspberry pi and see if I can go to that website on another computer on the same network.

Of course, just a complet barebones text-only site would be no fun at all, so I figured I'd make a little checklist app.
